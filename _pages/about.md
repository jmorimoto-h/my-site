Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at UC Berkeley, Graduate Student Fellow at the Stanford University Law School RegLab, and a Consultant for the World Bank Group. My research spans theoretical machine learning, empirical legal research, and topics at the intersection of law and machine learning. I am a Fulbright Scholar, and have also received previous research support from Harvard University and the University of Tokyo (Institute of Social Science). I am also a former Associate at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. I hold a J.D. from Harvard University and a B.A. in Mathematics from Case Western Reserve University. While at Harvard, I was a recipient of the Human Rights Program and Chayes Fellowships for international legal practice and research. Outside of work, I do ballet. I am a dancer with the Cardinal Ballet Company at Stanford and an alumnus of the Harvard Ballet Company.
